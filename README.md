## File Usage

* cfg.ipynb : define audio preprocessing class
* eda.ipynb : visualize input data, clean or resample audio files if necessary
* model.ipynb : train neural network
* predict.ipynb : test the neural network


## Setup a conda virtual environment (windows)

activate audio
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
